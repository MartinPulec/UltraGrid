To add GPUJPEG support, you need GPUJPEG library compiled and installed
in your system. GPUJPEG is distributed as a submodule of UltraGrid, so
you can make following steps in UltraGrid top directory in order to build
GPUJPEG and UltraGrid with GPUJPEG support:

$ git submodule --update init
$ cd gpujpeg
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install

Then, configure Ultragrid as usual with autogen.sh or configure script.
It should detect GPUJPEG automatically.
